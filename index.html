                    Software Developer and Computer Scientist with hands-on experience in automation, 
                    web development, and full-stack application design. Currently working as a Software Developer 
                    Engineer at Ajinomoto Cambrooke, where I’ve led the development of a real-time kitting automation 
                    web app that integrates hardware and software systems to streamline warehouse operations. The application, 
                    built with React, Flask, and MySQL, bridges the gap between physical and digital inventory processes, 
                    reducing human error, increasing efficiency, and saving hours of manual data entry for the business team.
